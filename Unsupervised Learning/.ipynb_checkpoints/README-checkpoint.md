### Unsupervised Machine Learning Methods
In this folder, we demonstrated unsupervised machine learning methods such as K-means, hierarchical clustering, and PCA analysis. We intended to figure out
1. What is the optimal number of variables to perform K-means clustering?
2. How good can we analyze the differential pattern of gene expressions between N0 and N1 groups using unsupervised learning.
