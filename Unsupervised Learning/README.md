### Unsupervised Machine Learning Methods
In this folder, we demonstrated unsupervised machine learning methods such as K-means, hierarchical clustering, and PCA analysis. We intended to figure out
1. What is the optimal number of variables to perform K-means clustering?
2. How good can we analyze the differential pattern of gene expressions between N0 and N1 groups using unsupervised learning. 
    a. What is the best perfromance of K-mean clustering in accuracy and MCC?
    b. Using the set fo features selected by K-mean clustering, does hierarchical clustering seperates the two groups successfully?
    c. Using the set fo features selected by K-mean clustering, does PCA seperates the two groups successfully?

The Contextualize_Kmeans.ipynb file described the necessity of reducing number of features.
The KMeans.ipynb file described Q1 and Q2.a.
The Hierarchical.ipynb file described Q2.b.
The PCA.ipynb file described Q2.c.
