# Supervised Machine Learning Methods
In this folder, we demonstrated supervised machine learning methods such as Naive Bayesian Classification and Neural Networks. We intended to figure out
1. What is the optimal number of variables to perform  Naive Bayesian classification?

2. What is the best perfromance of  Naive Bayesian classification in accuracy and MCC?

3. Using the set fo features selected by  Naive Bayesian classification, how good is the performance of Neural Networks?

## Coding Files
1. The NB.ipynb file described Q1 and Q2.

2. The NN.ipynb file described Q3.

## Output Files
After running this folder, you will get

1. NB_Accu_MCC.png from NB.ipynb that save the result of finding optimal features using NB.

2. NB_Confusion Matrix CV.png from NB.ipynb that save the result of a confusion matrix of the best model of NB usig cross validation.

3. NB_Confusion Matrix test.png from NB.ipynb that save the result of a confusion matrix of the best model of NB usig cross test dataset.

4. NN_Accu_loss.png from NN.ipynb that save the result of accuracy and loss curve using NN.
